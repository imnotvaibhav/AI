Make sure the file exists:**\\n\\n   * **Download the data:** If you don\\'t have the \\'AAPL.csv\\' file, you need to download it. You can find Apple stock data from resources like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or financial data providers. \\n   * **Save the file correctly:** Save the downloaded file as \\'AAPL.csv\\' in the same directory where your Python script is located.\\n\\n**2. Check the file path:**\\n\\n   * **Absolute path:** If the file is located in a different directory, use the absolute path to the file. For example, if the file is in \\'/home/user/data\\', the code would be:\\n     ```python\\n     data = pd.read_csv(\\'/home/user/data/AAPL.csv\\', index_col=\\'Date\\', parse_dates=True)\\n     ```\\n   * **Relative path:** If the file is in a subdirectory, use a relative path. For example, if the file is in \\'data\\' folder within the same directory as the script, use:\\n     ```python\\n     data = pd.read_csv(\\'data/AAPL.csv\\', index_col=\\'Date\\', parse_dates=True)\\n     ```\\n\\n**3. Verify file name and case:**\\n\\n   * **Check for typos:** Make sure the file name is spelled correctly (AAPL.csv) and case-sensitive (\\'AAPL.csv\\' is different from \\'aapl.csv\\').\\n\\n**4. Run the code again:**\\n\\n   * Once you\\'ve addressed the file path issue, run the Python code again. It should now be able to find and load the \\'AAPL.csv\\' file.\\n\\n**Important Note:** The code you provided assumes you are using an LSTM model for forecasting. This is a more complex approach and might not be the best for short-term predictions (5 days). Consider simpler forecasting methods like ARIMA or moving averages for this specific case. \\n', 'name': 'Analyst', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'exitcode: 1 (execution failed)\\nCode output: \\n  File \"\", line 1\\n    data = pd.read_csv(\\'/home/user/data/AAPL.csv\\', index_col=\\'Date\\', parse_dates=True)\\nIndentationError: unexpected indent\\n', 'name': 'Executor', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '```python\\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense\\nfrom tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n\\n# Data Gathering\\ndef get_apple_stock_data():\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Gets historical Apple stock data from a CSV file.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    data = pd.read_csv(\\'AAPL.csv\\', index_col=\\'Date\\', parse_dates=True)\\n    return data\\n\\n# Preprocessing\\ndef prepare_data(data, lookback):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Prepares the data for LSTM training.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    data[\\'Close\\'] = data[\\'Close\\'].values.astype(float)\\n    data = data[[\\'Close\\']]\\n    data[\\'Close\\'] = data[\\'Close\\'].fillna(method=\\'ffill\\')\\n    values = data.values\\n    scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))\\n    scaled_values = scaler.fit_transform(values)\\n    X, y = [], []\\n    for i in range(lookback, len(scaled_values)):\\n        X.append(scaled_values[i - lookback:i, 0])\\n        y.append(scaled_values[i, 0])\\n    return np.array(X), np.array(y), scaler\\n\\n# Model Building\\ndef build_lstm_model(lookback):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Creates an LSTM model.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    model = Sequential()\\n    model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(lookback, 1)))\\n    model.add(LSTM(units=50))\\n    model.add(Dense(1))\\n    model.compile(loss=\\'mean_squared_error\\', optimizer=\\'adam\\')\\n    return model\\n\\n# Model Training and Evaluation\\ndef train_and_evaluate_model(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, lookback):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Trains and evaluates the LSTM model.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    model = build_lstm_model(lookback)\\n    early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor=\\'val_loss\\', patience=10)\\n    history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), callbacks=[early_stopping])\\n    plt.plot(history.history[\\'loss\\'], label=\\'Training Loss\\')\\n    plt.plot(history.history[\\'val_loss\\'], label=\\'Validation Loss\\')\\n    plt.legend()\\n    plt.title(\\'Training and Validation Loss\\')\\n    plt.show()\\n    return model\\n\\n# Forecasting\\ndef generate_forecast(model, scaler, X_test, n_days):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Generates a forecast for the next n days.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    predicted_values = []\\n    last_n_days = X_test[-1]\\n    for i in range(n_days):\\n        predicted_value = model.predict(last_n_days.reshape(1, lookback, 1))\\n        predicted_values.append(predicted_value[0][0])\\n        last_n_days = np.append(last_n_days[1:], predicted_value, axis=0)\\n    predicted_values = np.array(predicted_values).reshape(-1, 1)\\n    inverted_predictions = scaler.inverse_transform(predicted_values)\\n    return inverted_predictions\\n\\n# Main Function\\nif __name__ == \\'__main__\\':\\n    data = get_apple_stock_data()\\n    # Split data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing)\\n    train_data = data[:-30]\\n    test_data = data[-30:]\\n\\n    # Set the lookback period (number of past days to consider for each prediction)\\n    lookback = 10\\n    X_train, y_train, scaler = prepare_data(train_data, lookback)\\n    X_test, y_test, _ = prepare_data(test_data, lookback)\\n    \\n    model = train_and_evaluate_model(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, lookback)\\n\\n    # Generate forecast for the next 5 days\\n    n_days = 5\\n    forecast = generate_forecast(model, scaler, X_test, n_days)\\n\\n    # Analyze and interpret the forecast \\n    if forecast[-1] > forecast[-2]:\\n        print(\\'Apple stock prices are forecasted to increase for the next 5 days.

AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and seamlessly allow human participation. They can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools.\\n\\n![AutoGen Overview](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/website/static/img/autogen_agentchat.png)\\n\\n- AutoGen enables building next-gen LLM applications based on [multi-agent conversations](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat) with minimal effort. It simplifies the orchestration, automation, and optimization of a complex LLM workflow. It maximizes the performance of LLM models and overcomes their weaknesses.\\n- It supports [diverse conversation patterns](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat#supporting-diverse-conversation-patterns) for complex workflows. With customizable and conversable agents, developers can use AutoGen to build a wide range of conversation patterns concerning conversation autonomy,\\n  the number of agents, and agent conversation topology.\\n- It provides a collection of working systems with different complexities. These systems span a [wide range of applications](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat#diverse-applications-implemented-with-autogen) from various domains and complexities. This demonstrates how AutoGen can easily support diverse conversation patterns.\\n- AutoGen provides [enhanced LLM inference](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/enhanced_inference#api-unification). It offers utilities like API unification and caching, and advanced usage patterns, such as error handling, multi-config inference, context programming, etc.\\n\\nAutoGen is created out of collaborative [research](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Research) from Microsoft, Penn State University, and the University of Washington.\\n\\n<p align=\"right\" style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\">\\n  <a href=\"#readme-top\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\">\\n    ↑ Back to Top ↑\\n  </a>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Roadmaps\\n\\nTo see what we are working on and what we plan to work on, please check our\\n[Roadmap Issues](https://aka.ms/autogen-roadmap).\\n\\n<p align=\"right\" style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\">\\n  <a href=\"#readme-top\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\">\\n    ↑ Back to Top ↑\\n  </a>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Quickstart\\nThe easiest way to start playing is\\n1. Click below to use the GitHub Codespace\\n\\n    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/microsoft/autogen?quickstart=1)\\n\\n 2. Copy OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample to ./notebook folder, name to OAI_CONFIG_LIST, and set the correct configuration.\\n 3. Start playing with the notebooks!\\n\\n*NOTE*: OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample lists GPT-4 as the default model, as this represents our current recommendation, and is known to work well with AutoGen. If you use a model other than GPT-4, you may need to revise various system prompts (especially if using weaker models like GPT-3.5-turbo). Moreover, if you use models other than those hosted by OpenAI or Azure, you may incur additional risks related to alignment and safety. Proceed with caution if updating this default.\\n\\n<p align=\"right\" style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\">\\n  <a href=\"#readme-top\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\">\\n    ↑ Back to Top ↑\\n  </a>\\n</p>\\n\\n## [Installation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Installation)\\n### Option 1. Install and Run AutoGen in Docker\\n\\nFind detailed instructions for users [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/installation/Docker#step-1-install-docker), and for developers [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Contribute#docker-for-development).\\n\\n### Option 2. Install AutoGen Locally\\n\\nAutoGen requires **Python version >= 3.8, < 3.13**. It can be installed from pip:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install pyautogen\\n```\\n\\nMinimal dependencies are installed without extra options. You can install extra options based on the feature you need.\\n\\n<!-- For example, use the following to install the dependencies needed by the [`blendsearch`](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#blendsearch-economical-hyperparameter-optimization-with-blended-search-strategy) option.\\n```bash\\npip install \"pyautogen[blendsearch]\"\\n``` -->\\n\\nFind more options in [Installation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Installation#option-2-install-autogen-locally-using-virtual-environment).\\n\\n<!-- Each of the [`notebook examples`](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/notebook) may require a specific option to be installed. -->\\n\\nEven if you are installing and running AutoGen locally outside of docker, the recommendation and default behavior of agents is to perform [code execution](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/FAQ/#code-execution) in docker. Find more instructions and how to change the default behaviour [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Installation#code-execution-with-docker-(default)).\\n\\nFor LLM inference configurations, check the [FAQs](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/FAQ#set-your-api-endpoints).\\n\\n<p align=\"right\" style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\">\\n  <a href=\"#readme-top\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\">\\n    ↑ Back to Top ↑\\n  </a>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Multi-Agent Conversation Framework\\n\\nAutogen enables the next-gen LLM applications with a generic [multi-agent conversation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat) framework. It offers customizable and conversable agents that integrate LLMs, tools, and humans.\\nBy automating chat among multiple capable agents, one can easily make them collectively perform tasks autonomously or with human feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code.\\n\\nFeatures of this use case include:\\n\\n- **Multi-agent conversations**: AutoGen agents can communicate with each other to solve tasks. This allows for more complex and sophisticated applications than would be possible with a single LLM.\\n- **Customization**: AutoGen agents can be customized to meet the specific needs of an application. This includes the ability to choose the LLMs to use, the types of human input to allow, and the tools to employ.\\n- **Human participation**: AutoGen seamlessly allows human participation. This means that humans can provide input and feedback to the agents as needed.\\n\\nFor [example](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/test/twoagent.py),\\n```python\\nfrom autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, config_list_from_json\\n# Load LLM inference endpoints from an env variable or a file\\n# See https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/FAQ#set-your-api-endpoints\\n# and OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample\\nconfig_list = config_list_from_json(env_or_file=\"OAI_CONFIG_LIST\")\\n# You can also set config_list directly as a list, for example, config_list = [{\\'model\\': \\'gpt-4\\', \\'api_key\\': \\'<your OpenAI API key here>\\'},]\\nassistant = AssistantAgent(\"assistant\", llm_config={\"config_list\": config_list})\\nuser_proxy = UserProxyAgent(\"user_proxy\", code_execution_config={\"work_dir\": \"coding\", \"use_docker\": False}) # IMPORTANT: set to True to run code in docker, recommended\\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message=\"Plot a chart of NVDA and TESLA stock price change YTD.\")\\n# This initiates an automated chat between the two agents to solve the task\\n```\\n\\nThis example can be run with\\n\\n```python\\npython test/twoagent.py\\n```\\n\\nAfter the repo is cloned.\\nThe figure below shows an example conversation flow with AutoGen.\\n![Agent Chat Example](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/website/static/img/chat_example.png)\\n\\nAlternatively, the [sample code](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/samples/simple_chat.py) here allows a user to chat with an AutoGen agent in ChatGPT style.\\nPlease find more [code examples](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Examples#automated-multi-agent-chat) for this feature.\\n\\n<p align=\"right\" style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\">\\n  <a href=\"#readme-top\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\">\\n    ↑ Back to Top ↑\\n  </a>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Enhanced LLM Inferences\\n\\nAutogen also helps maximize the utility out of the expensive LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. It offers [enhanced LLM inference](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/enhanced_inference#api-unification) with powerful functionalities like caching, error handling, multi-config inference and templating.\\n\\n<!-- For example, you can optimize generations by LLM with your own tuning data, success metrics, and budgets.\\n\\n```python\\n# perform tuning for openai<1\\nconfig, analysis = autogen.Completion.tune(\\n    data=tune_data,\\n    metric=\"success\",\\n    mode=\"max\",\\n    eval_func=eval_func,\\n    inference_budget=0.05,\\n    optimization_budget=3,\\n    num_samples=-1,\\n)\\n# perform inference for a test instance\\nresponse = autogen.Completion.create(context=test_instance, **config)\\n```\\n\\nPlease find more [code examples](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Examples#tune-gpt-models) for this feature. -->\\n\\n<p align=\"right\" style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\">\\n  <a href=\"#readme-top\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\">\\n    ↑ Back to Top ↑\\n  </a>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nYou can find detailed documentation about AutoGen [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/).\\n\\nIn addition, you can find:\\n\\n- [Research](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Research), [blogposts](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog) around AutoGen, and [Transparency FAQs](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/TRANSPARENCY_FAQS.md)\\n\\n- [Discord](https://aka.ms/autogen-dc)\\n\\n- [Contributing guide](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Contribute)\\n\\n- [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/microsoft/projects/989/views/3)\\n\\n<p align=\"right\" style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\">\\n  <a href=\"#readme-top\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\">\\n    ↑ Back to Top ↑\\n  </a>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Related Papers\\n\\n[AutoGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155)\\n\\n```\\n@inproceedings{wu2023autogen,\\n      title={AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation Framework},\\n      author={Qingyun Wu and Gagan Bansal and Jieyu Zhang and Yiran Wu and Beibin Li and Erkang Zhu and Li Jiang and Xiaoyun Zhang and Shaokun Zhang and Jiale Liu and Ahmed Hassan Awadallah and Ryen W White and Doug Burger and Chi Wang},\\n      year={2023},\\n      eprint={2308.08155},\\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\\n      primaryClass={cs.AI}\\n}\\n```\\n\\n[EcoOptiGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04673)\\n\\n```\\n@inproceedings{wang2023EcoOptiGen,\\n    title={Cost-Effective Hyperparameter Optimization for Large Language Model Generation Inference},\\n    author={Chi Wang and Susan Xueqing Liu and Ahmed H.

            "   - `new_distance = distances[current_node] + weight`: Calculates the potential new distance to the neighbor.\n",
            "   - `if new_distance < distances[neighbor]`: If the new distance is shorter than the current shortest distance to the neighbor, update the shortest distance and the predecessor.\n",
