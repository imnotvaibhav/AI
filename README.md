# Microsoft Autogen implementation with local LLM 
* This was the assignment I did for a company for AI Engineer role.
* Through this assignment I learned about the microsoft autogen, which is an interesting and effective way to make you LLM produce even better results than they alreasy do. Microsoft AutoGen is a framework for building applications that leverage the power of large language models (LLMs).  Instead of a single LLM, AutoGen allows you to create workflows using multiple agents that can converse with each other.
* This assignment include working on Microsoft autogen with local LLM models from HuggingFace and leveraging RAG based arcitecture to solve simple task like time series forecasting.



* Assignment_autogen_RAG_HF is the main file.
Other are practice notebooks.
